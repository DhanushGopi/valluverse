# valluverse

VALLUVERSE is an Open Course Platform where you can explore exclusive literature content like Thirukural, and test your philology skills.
Starting with Thirukural recognition, we hope to support students, scholars, and the general public in engaging with philology and reading Thirukural modernly.
